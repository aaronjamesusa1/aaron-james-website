            <li>"Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires." (Galatians 5:24)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>9. Victory In Christ</h2>

            <li>"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more." (Isaiah 43:25)</li>
